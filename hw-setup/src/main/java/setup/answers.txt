1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test because it threw an
exception for 0 but 0 is nonnegative. I changed the condition for it to throw an
IllegalArgumentException to be < 0 rather than <= 0.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because it considered 0 as a negative
number; I changed the condition for it to throw an IllegalArgumentException from <= 0 to < 0.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase test because it returned the wrong number
for its parameter of (2). I changed the else return to be a sum rather than a
difference; I changed the base case's condition to be < 2 rather than <= 2.
