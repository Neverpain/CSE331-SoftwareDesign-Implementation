# Tests the findPath method from a node, n1, to another node, n4, that has two same
# length paths and prints out the most alphabetical path, edges added in reverse

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g

added edge B from n1 to n2 in g
added edge A from n1 to n2 in g

path from n1 to n2:
n1 to n2 via A
