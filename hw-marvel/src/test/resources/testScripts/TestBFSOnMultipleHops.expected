# Tests that the findPath method works on multistep pathing from one node to
# another, prints out path

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in g

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 via e1
n2 to n3 via e2
n3 to n4 via e3
