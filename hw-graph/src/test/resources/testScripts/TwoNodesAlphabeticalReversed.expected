# Tests adding two nodes to a graph, and a pair of nodes (in reverse order) will
# print in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n2 to graph1
added node n1 to graph1

# Print the nodes contained in the graph and outgoing edges to the nodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are:
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
