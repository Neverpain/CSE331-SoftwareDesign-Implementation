# Tests that a graph can be created, a node can be
# added to it, a edge pointing to itself can be added,
# and the node and its edge can be printed out

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge n1n1 to n1

# Prints the nodes contained in the graph and their edges
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1
