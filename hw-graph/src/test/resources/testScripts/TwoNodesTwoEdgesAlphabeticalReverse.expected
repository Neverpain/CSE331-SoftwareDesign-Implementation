# Tests that two edges can be added to a graph, and that
# a pair of nodes and a two edges (in reverse order) connecting them
# can be printed out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add two edges
added edge n1n22 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge n1n2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes contained in the graph and the
# edges outgoing from the parentNodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(n1n2) n2(n1n22)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
