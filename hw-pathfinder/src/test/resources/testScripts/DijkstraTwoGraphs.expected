# Tests that Dijkstra's algorithm works properly on two
# separate graphs

created graph g1
created graph g2

added node A to g1
added node B to g1
added node A to g2
added node B to g2

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g1
added edge 1.000 from A to B in g2

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
