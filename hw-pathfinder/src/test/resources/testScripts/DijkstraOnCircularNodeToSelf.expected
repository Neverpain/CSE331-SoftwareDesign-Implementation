# Tests finding the path using Dijkstra's algorithm from a node, to another node
# than back to the original node and prints out the path

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 1.000 from B to C in g
added edge 1.000 from C to A in g

path from A to A:
total cost: 0.000

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000

path from C to A:
C to A with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
