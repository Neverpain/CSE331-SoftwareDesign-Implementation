# Tests that Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't have defined behavior for outputting paths
# when there are two minimum-cost paths

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g
added node D to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 3.000 from B to D in g
added edge 2.000 from A to C in g
added edge 2.000 from C to D in g

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to D with weight 3.000
total cost: 4.000
